Installation instructions
=========================


conversation_analytics_toolkit can be installed using pip::

    $ python -m pip install conversation_analytics_toolkit

This command will fetch the archive and its dependencies from the internet and
install them.

If you've downloaded the tarball, unpack it, and execute::

    $ python setup.py install --user

You might prefer to install it as system-wide. In this case, skip the ``--user``
option and execute as superuser by prepending the command with ``sudo``.
